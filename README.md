# üèà NFL Decision-Making with Machine Learning: Play & Scheme Prediction

Welcome to the **NFL Decision-Making with Machine Learning** project, where we dive deep into some of the most complex challenges faced by NFL teams. This repository showcases how machine learning can be used to analyze game data, predict outcomes, and assist coaches and teams in making **data-driven decisions** during high-stakes situations.

## üöÄ The Challenge

In the NFL, **every play matters**. Coaches and teams must make split-second decisions that can mean the difference between victory and defeat. But how can they consistently make the right call when the stakes are so high? NFL teams face multiple decision-making challenges, including:

- **Play Prediction**: Should the offense call a pass or a run? Can the defense anticipate and react in time?
- **Scheme Prediction**: What defensive alignment will best counter the offense? Should the defense blitz, cover deep, or play zone?
- **Player Positioning**: What will the QB's target be on this play? Who should the defense focus on?
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: How can teams adapt dynamically based on current game conditions to maximize success?

NFL teams are increasingly integrating data and **NextGenStats** to gain an edge on their opponents, but understanding and processing these vast datasets can be daunting.

## üí° The Solution: Intelligent Decision-Making with ML

This project tackles these challenges head-on by leveraging **machine learning** to predict crucial game outcomes. Specifically, the solution focuses on:

- **Play and Scheme Prediction**: Using **historical NFL game data**, including play-by-play, player tracking, and contextual game information, the model predicts the **Expected Points Added (EPA)** for various game scenarios.
- **Predictive Modeling**: The model predicts the success of different offensive and defensive schemes, helping teams anticipate the opponent's moves and make more effective decisions in real time.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: The system can identify key factors such as down, distance, field position, and defensive coverage to assess how likely a team is to succeed on a given play.

By combining **NFL game data** and **NextGenStats**, this project demonstrates the power of ML to transform the way teams think about playcalling and game strategy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Data**: We used **play-by-play data** that includes rich features like down, yards to go, offensive and defensive formations, player alignments, and more. The model integrates this data with **team performance** to generate insightful predictions.
- **Modeling Approach**: We built and fine-tuned a **Random Forest Regressor**, a powerful machine learning algorithm that predicts the **Expected Points Added (EPA)** for different game scenarios. Through feature engineering, we analyzed how key variables influence game outcomes and tuned the model to provide accurate predictions.
- **Scenarios**: Our model tests different **game scenarios** to predict how likely an offensive play is to succeed. By adjusting variables like down, field position, and defense, the model generates predictions on the most favorable outcomes for the offense.

## üìä Example Predictions

- **Scenario 1**: **3rd Down & 5 yards**, on the team's **25-yard line**, facing **Cover-3 defense**‚ÄîResult: EPA of **-1.69** (high-risk play, likely leading to a punt or turnover).
- **Scenario 2**: **2nd Down & 7 yards**, on the **opponent's 15-yard line**, against a weak defense like the **Detroit Lions**‚ÄîResult: EPA of **+0.30** (successful play likely leading to scoring).

These predictions help coaches and analysts make data-informed decisions in key moments.
